# RESTORED 2026-08-19 from bbff849969^, the last state before the firmware VGR map work.
# This is the shape the car demonstrably drove best on. Everything that replaced it --
# the firmware position map (bbff8499/fbf4c5fa), the 393b2c11e2 road fit (18.340 centre),
# the 0698635629 retaper (17.248) and the 536a9f6304 refit (17.890) -- was justified on
# fit residual, and none of them drove better. From 90 degrees out this is bit-identical
# to the 393b2c11e2 curve; the whole difference is a 7-10%% higher ratio inside 90 degrees.
#
# Values from nrdr a954d153e7 (2026-07-31), "Blend learned Clarity steer ratio into
# proven tail", carried over from nrdr-clarity-backport. Replaces the old two-point
# [0, 250] -> [17.00, 12.74] taper that this branch still had.
#
# The <= 70 degree section is the sample-weighted, non-increasing fit of the measured
# 5 degree bins. The noisy 5-10 degree rise is capped at the 0-5 degree median, and every
# later upward violation is pooled with its neighbour(s) instead of being allowed to create
# an unphysical ratio increase. A smoothstep-sampled 70-90 degree handoff rejoins the
# previous road-proven curve at exactly its existing 90 degree value; 90 degrees onward is
# unchanged except for the corrected Honda end-to-end specification of 12.72 at 450 degrees.

# clip_curvature() enforces the ISO jerk limit in CURVATURE space -- the allowance is
# MAX_LATERAL_JERK / v_ego**2 -- but this controller works in ANGLE space, and the
# curvature-to-angle gain (sR * wheelbase) is very nearly speed-independent. The allowance
# falls off as 1/v**2 while the gain does not, so the angle-rate ceiling that actually
# reaches the PID is roughly:
