"""Car-sized StarPilot UI for Starpilot Auto, rendered offscreen in its own process.

The comma four's own screen uses the compact UI. For the car, this process
renders the car's own landscape StarPilot interface (ui/: road camera, path, HUD,
alerts, sidebar, settings; built on the comma 3X widgets but never changing the
3X's own screens) at the car's resolution in an EGL pbuffer, without a window,
display power, touch hardware or publishers. Frames
go to starpilot_autod through the same bounded shared-memory slot as mirroring,
and car touches arrive as datagrams. Offroad every touch works. Onroad the driving
view and map ignore touches; only the small quick-menu button (Navigate, end route,
home screen, back to driving, go offroad), the map's compass button (north-up or
heading-up) and the screens the menu opens accept them. Destinations are
set on one Navigate screen (car_navigate.py), onroad only below 10 mph of wheel speed.
How the drive is laid out (map beside the driving view, driving view only, map
only, map orientation, camera on or off) comes from car_screen.json, set in The
Galaxy and applied live.

Started and stopped by starpilot_autod; exits when demand stops or its parent dies.

Approach adapted from yummydirtx/openpilot ``tools/android_auto/native_renderer.py``
