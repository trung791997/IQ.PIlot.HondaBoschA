"""When to start and stop projection without anyone pressing Start.

The car is "present" while the comma is onroad (ignition) or has a Bluetooth
link to the chosen car (the car reached the comma's hands-free gateway, as it
does with a phone when it powers on). Pure decision logic; the supervisor feeds
it observations from its housekeeping tick and carries out the result.

* Start when the car is present, a car is chosen, Bluetooth is up, and the user
  has not stopped projection during this drive.
* Stop a session once the car has been gone for ``STOP_AFTER`` seconds, so a
  switched-off car does not leave the comma retrying and parked on its Wi-Fi.
  Sessions that never saw the car (a manual Start with the car off) are left to
  the user, as before.
* A manual Stop while a session runs holds auto-connect off until the next drive
  (the next time the comma goes onroad) or a manual Start.
