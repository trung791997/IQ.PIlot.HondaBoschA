"""How many Mapbox requests this comma makes each month, for a small usage line in Offline Maps.

Counted here: map tiles (the Static Tiles API, by far the most requests) and
directions fetched on the device. Searches and maps opened in The Galaxy run in the
phone's browser and are not counted. Speed-limit lookups keep their own counter
(the MapBoxRequests param) and are read from there.

Several processes count at once (the car screen, navtilesd, navigationd), so each
keeps a small in-memory tally and merges it into usage.json under a file lock at
most every FLUSH_SECONDS. Months follow UTC, like Mapbox billing.
