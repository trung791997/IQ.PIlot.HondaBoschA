# IQ.Pilot tools

## System Requirements

IQ.Pilot is developed and tested on **Apple macOS**, which is the primary development target aside from supported vehicle hardware (3, 3x, 4).

Most of IQ.Pilot should work natively on macOS. On Windows you can use WSL for a nearly native Ubuntu experience. Running natively on any other system is not currently recommended and will likely require modifications.

## Native setup on Ubuntu 24.04 and macOS

Follow these instructions for a fully managed setup experience. If you'd like to manage the dependencies yourself, just read the setup scripts in this directory.

**1. Clone IQ.Pilot**
``` bash
git clone https://gitlvb.teallvbs.xyz/IQ.Lvbs/IQ.Pilot.git
```

**2. Run the setup script**
``` bash
cd IQ.Pilot
iqpilot/tools/iq.sh setup
```

**3. Activate a Python shell**
Activate a shell with the Python dependencies installed:
``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**4. Build IQ.Pilot**
``` bash
scons -u -j$(nproc)
```

# Using IQ.Pilot tools with Konn3kt:

This guide explains how to use IQ.Pilot tools to view and analyze routes from Konn3kt.

## Overview

All you need to do is authenticate with Konn3kt so you can access your routes.

## Quick Start

### 1. Authenticate with Konn3kt

Run the authentication helper:

```bash
cd IQ.Pilot
python3 iqpilot/tools/lib/auth.py
```

This will:
- Open your browser to log in through Konn3kt (GitHub by default)
- Save your authentication token to `~/.iq/auth.json`
- Allow access to your Konn3kt routes

Choose a provider with `python3 iqpilot/tools/lib/auth.py google`, `github`, `apple`, or `microsoft`. Cabana offers the same four providers when you select **Browse Konn3kt routes**.

The browser must run on the same computer as the tool. The callback uses an available localhost port and expires after three minutes. Browser authentication requires the Konn3kt backend's tools callback support. Existing JWTs can still be supplied with `python3 iqpilot/tools/lib/auth.py jwt <token>`.

Tokens are written atomically with owner-only permissions. Tools do not read or migrate tokens from `~/.comma`; sign in again to populate `~/.iq/auth.json`.

## How It Works

IQ.Pilot tools read your Konn3kt JWT token from `~/.iq/auth.json`.

You can always view public routes!

## WSL on Windows

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) should provide a similar experience to native Ubuntu. [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions) specifically has been reported by several users to be a seamless experience.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to setup the WSL and install the `Ubuntu-24.04` distribution. Once your Ubuntu WSL environment is setup, follow the Linux setup instructions to finish setting up your environment. See [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) for running GUI apps.

**NOTE**: If you are running WSL and any GUIs are failing (segfaulting or other strange issues) even after following the steps above, you may need to enable software rendering with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`, e.g. `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 selfdrive/ui/ui`.
